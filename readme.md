# chrispratt
A simple zsh theme that isn't anything to write home about

## Installation
In order to use this theme, you need to have the following

* [oh-my-zsh] (https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
* [zsh] (http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)
* [git] (https://git-scm.com/)

Then...

"""
git clone https://github.com/Hayjw916/chrispratt.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/chrispratt
"""

To apply it, open your .zshrc file and change this line

"""
ZSH_THEME="chrispratt/chrispratt
"""

Now just apply the changes

"""
source ~/.zshrc
"""

Andddd there you go, now you have the theme installed.

*the theme is kind of broken, and it will probably get changed a lot because my tastes change sometimes. I'll keep 
a releases tab for the different versions*
